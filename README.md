## Javascript: Password Generator

This JavaScript tool lets you generate random passwords. You can customize the character set that includes lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and symbols.

## Description

The page will allow users to specify a length between 8-128 character for the password and whether or not the password should contain lowercase, uppercase, numbers, and/or symbols.

When the “Generate Password” is clicked, a prompt will ask the following criteria:
  1. "Please choose the length(between 8-128 characters) of your password: "
  2. "Do you want to include LOWERCASE characters?"
  3. "Do you want to include UPPERCASE characters?"
  4. "Do you want to include NUMBER characters?"
  5. "Do you want to include SYMBOL characters?"
  
  You must select a number between 8-128 to proceed to the next prompt. If you select 'cancel' to all the criterias, a password will not generate.


When the "Copy Password" is clicked, the displayed generated password will copy the password to the clipboard and prompt a message indicating that the password has been copied.
